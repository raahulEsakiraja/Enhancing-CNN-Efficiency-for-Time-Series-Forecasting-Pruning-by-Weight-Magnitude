Enhancing CNN Efficiency for Time Series Forecasting: Pruning by Weight Magnitude


Time series forecasting plays a critical role in various domains, from finance to supply chain

management. In recent years Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become more preva-
lent in time series forecasting due to their ability to understand ”spatial” structure of continuous

coordinates. A time coordinate works just as well as a spatial coordinate thus allowing CNNs

to be leveraged in this field. However, deep learning models like CNNs often face deploy-
ment challenges due to their high memory and computational demands. This paper explores

a magnitude-based weight pruning technique applied to a pre-trained CNN, reducing model
complexity by sparsifying low-magnitude weights and reapplying to model structure to create
a compact model. We evaluate the method using metrics like memory usage, execution time,
and predictive accuracy. Our results reveal that significant model compression can be achieved
without substantial loss in accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world forecasting
applications.

I have uploaded the colab used to get my results, a Python file for code, and the results of my findings summarised in a draft research paper.
